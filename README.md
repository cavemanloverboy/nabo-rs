This is a fork of nabo, which implements support for periodic boundaries in a very efficient manner. The API has changed minimally. The original README
from St√©phane Magnenat & Hannes Sommer is attached below:

## Overview

nabo is a fast K Nearest Neighbour (KNN) library for low-dimensional spaces.
It is a re-implementation in pure Rust of the [C++ library of the same name](https://github.com/ethz-asl/libnabo) by its [original author](http://stephane.magnenat.net).
This work has been sponsored by [Enlightware GmbH](https://enlightware.ch).

## Usage

To use nabo in your project, you need to implement the `nabo::Point` trait for your point type.
You can see an example in `src/dummy_point` which is available when nabo is compiled with the `dummy_point` feature (default).
If you want to avoid a dependency to `rand`, disable the `dummy_point` feature.

## Benchmark

You can benchmark nabo using the following command:

    cargo bench
